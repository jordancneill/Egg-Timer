This is a countdown timer app (ironically using an egg ImageView) with a maximum time of 20 minutes that can be set using a seekbar.  You may stop the countdown whenever you please using the stop button, and reset the time with the seekbar and the start button.  Developed using Java, alongside The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course on Udemy with changes made to the UI (Egg Image, constraints, size and format of buttons) and functionality (longer time available for the countdown).
